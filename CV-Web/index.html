						<h3>SEPTEMBER 2019 - JUNE 2022</h3>
						<h4>UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH - BSC COMPUTER SCIENCE (2:1)</h4>
						<h4>Final Project: Full-Stack Development, Quiz Game</h4>
						<p>The aim of this project was to create a quiz game which allowed students aged 12 - 16 to retain their focus and alleviate their boredom by introducing a competitive and fun aspect to learning from home during the times of lockdown.</p>
						<p>To develop the solution there was extensive research by reading studies on gamifying educational content and researching existing solutions using Google Scholar to find the necessary features to build to achieve the project's aim.</p>
						<p>
							Once the research was complete a web application was created which uses technologies such as React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Redux and Postman. By the end of the project, a functional Quiz Game application was built, allowing students to participate in a quiz created by the teacher using
							the web application; students could attempt the quiz and earn points which counted towards a leaderboard.
