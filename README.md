## What are microservices?

Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, in a service-oriented architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

## Why microservices?

Microservices are a way to break up an application into small, independent services. Each service is a small application that runs in its own process and communicates with other services using a lightweight mechanism, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

## What are the benefits of microservices?

| Benefits | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Scalability** | Microservices are small and independent, so they can be scaled up or down independently. |
| **Resilience** | If one microservice fails, the others remain unaffected. |
| **Technology diversity** | Microservices can be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies. |
| **Loose coupling** | Microservices are loosely coupled, so they can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. |
