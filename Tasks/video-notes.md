## What are Microservices?

Microservices are a software development technique it follows an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled independent services.

Each service is a small application that runs in its own process and communicates with other services using a lightweight mechanism, often an HTTP resource API.

## Benefits of Microservices

* **Scalability** - Microservices are small and independent, so they can be scaled up or down.
* **Resilience** - If one microservice fails, the others remain unaffected.
* **Loose coupling** - Microservices are loosely coupled, so they can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications as quickly as possible.
Docker packages software into standardised units known as containers.
Containers have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools and code.
Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

## Virtual vs Containerization?

Virtualization supports executing multiple operating systems on a single physical server, whereas Containerization supports deploying multiple applications developed in the environment of one operating system residing on a single virtual machine or a server.
